# OneBoard – Personal Finance Dashboard

OneBoard is a personal finance dashboard built to simulate a real-world application while focusing on **frontend architecture, state management, and TypeScript modeling**.

It emphasizes predictable state, explicit domain modeling, and clear separation of concerns.

The goal of this project is not to create a full finance product, but to demonstrate how a medium-sized dashboard app can be structured in a scalable and maintainable way.

## 🧠 What this project demonstrates

This repository showcases:

- Structuring a Next.js application for scalability  
- Modeling domain data using TypeScript  
- Managing complex UI state with a centralized store  
- Separating business logic from UI components  
- Building dashboard-style interfaces with derived metrics  

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript  
- Tailwind CSS  
- Zustand for global state  
- React Hook Form  
- Recharts  
- Local mock data (simulating API responses)

This project follows a feature-based architecture with centralized domain typing to ensure scalability and maintainability.
